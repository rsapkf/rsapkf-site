### Now

Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff)' idea.

Currently, I'm focused on learning Computer Science and Full-Stack Web Development. My major focus in on Python, JavaScript and Linux. I'm also trying to improve my writing, puzzle solving, and Japanese.

I am eagerly awaiting the release of [Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(TV_series)) TV-Series.
