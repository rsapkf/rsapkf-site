### Now

I am self-learning ([<small>Why?</small>](/thoughts/autodidacticism)) Computer Science and Full-Stack Web Development.

Resources that I use:
- [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
- [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/)
- [other goodies](https://github.com/rsapkf/42/)

Right now, I am specifically working through the [Algorithms](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) book by Sedgewick and Wayne, [Introduction to Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition)  by Cormen et al., and [Mathematics for CS](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring17/mcs.pdf)  lecture notes from MIT, among other things.
