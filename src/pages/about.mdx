### About Me

I am self-learning ([<small>Why?</small>](/thoughts/autodidacticism)) Computer Science and Full-Stack Web Development.

Resources that I use:
- [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
- [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/)
- [other goodies](https://github.com/rsapkf/42/)

Right now, I am specifically working through the [Algorithms](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) book by Sedgewick and Wayne, [Introduction to Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition)  by Cormen et al., and [Mathematics for CS](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring17/mcs.pdf)  lecture notes from MIT, among other things.

My &asymp;Dob is [978307200](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=unix+time+978307200).

I'm an [introvert](http://typelogic.com/intj.html) &bull; [MBTI#Criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator#Criticism), a [perfectionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectionism_(psychology))and an aspiring [polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath). I like to share what I find interesting, and learn everything I can.

Besides programming, my interests and hobbies include:
- Physics + Mathematics
- Speedcubing (Rubik's Cube, sub 30, [CFOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFOP_Method) + [variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube#Variations))
