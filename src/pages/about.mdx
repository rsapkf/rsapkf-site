### About

I'm a full-stack web developer. I use HTML5 + CSS3 + ES6, Django, React, Node, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and the Jamstack. I am interested in ML, Mathematics and [theoretical computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science).

I was born around [978307200](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=unix+time+978307200) seconds after the Unix epoch. Being a [perfectionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectionism_(psychology)) and an aspiring [polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath), I like to share what I find interesting and learn everything I can.

Other interests and hobbies:
- Tinkering with Linux systems
- Speedcubing (Rubik's Cube, sub 30, [CFOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFOP_Method) + [BLD](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Blindfolded_Solving) + [variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube#Variations))
- Physics, Recreational Mathematics, Chess, Crosswords, <Link to="/puzzles">Puzzles</Link>
- Philosphy ([Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism)) / Art / History / Biology / Psychology
- <Link to="/books">Reading</Link> + <Link to="/movies-tv">Watching</Link> Science Fiction
- [Conlangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) and language learning (**Fun fact**: I speak 6 languages (more like 4+0.9+0.5)!)
- Personal Knowledge Management
- Homelab / Self-hosting
- Comics, Anime, Webtoons and Memes
- Making looong lists :)
