### About

I'm Rey, a full-stack web developer. I use the MERN stack, Django, PostgreSQL, and the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org). Other technologies that I use on a regular/semi-regular basis can be found on the <Link to="/technologies">Technologies</Link> page. I am interested in [theoretical computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science), particularly ML and Mathematics.

I was born around [978307200](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=unix+time+978307200) seconds after the Unix epoch. Being a [perfectionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectionism_(psychology)) and an aspiring [polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath), I like to share what I find interesting and learn everything I can.

Other interests and hobbies (feel free to <Link to="/contact">talk</Link> to me about any):
- Tinkering with Linux systems
- Speedcubing (Rubik's Cube, sub 30, [CFOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFOP_Method) + [BLD](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Blindfolded_Solving) + [variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube#Variations))
- Physics, Recreational Mathematics, Chess, Crosswords, <Link to="/puzzles">Puzzles</Link>
- Philosphy ([Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism)), Art, History, Biology, Psychology
- <Link to="/books">Reading</Link> + <Link to="/movies-tv">Watching</Link> Science Fiction
- [Conlangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language), Language Learning (**Fun fact**: I speak 6 languages! (more like 4+0.9+0.5))
- Personal Knowledge Management
- Homelab / Self-hosting
- Comics, Anime, Music, Podcasts, all the usual stuff
- Making looong lists :)
