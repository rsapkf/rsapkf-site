### About &gt;&gt; To Learn

Some things in my "To Learn" or "Getting Into" list:

- [Japanology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_studies)
- [Ambidexterity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambidexterity)  
  This has improved a lot because of cubing but my handwriting with non-dominant hand still needs a lot of work.
- Memory Tricks  
  Currently reading _**Remember It!**_ by **Nelson Dellis**. A while ago, I tried reading _**Secrets of Mental Math**_ by **Arthur Benjamin** but couldn't complete. Learnt some very cool tricks though. I want to work on my personal [mind palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci) when I get the time to.
- Juggling
- Yoyoing
