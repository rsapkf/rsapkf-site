Learning to code from YouTube is nice but I prefer to follow a nicely structured MOOC online along with a textbook (with exercises). This not only allows me to fully grasp the key concepts while focusing on the fundamentals but also to gradually build up from those first principles. Moreover, this kind of approach is vastly important in learning mathematics.

This is **not** a structured curriculum equivalent to a CS degree. These courses are, in my opinion, some of the most well-developed MOOCs that are available/auditable for free online. I have added links to corresponding supplementary books that go with each course. My focus is on **theoretical CS** (data structures, algorithms, and their analysis, computational complexity theory), **mathematics for CS** (discrete math, linear algebra, calculus, differential equations), and **coding** (programming paradigms, data science, ML, full-stack web development, frameworks, and libraries).

### <u>Courses</u>

#### Introductory CS and Programming:

- [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) ([CS50 on edX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science)) - Prof. David J. Malan.
- [MITx's Computational Thinking using Python XSeries - edX](https://www.edx.org/xseries/mitx-computational-thinking-using-python) - Prof. Eric Grimson, Prof. John Guttag.

  This XSeries program contains 2 courses on introductory programming and computational thinking:

  - [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7)
    ([MIT 6.0001 on OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)), [MIT 6.0001 on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63WbdFxL8giv4yhgdMGaZNA))

  This is MIT's classic introductory CS and electrical engineering course taught using [Scheme](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)>) that was later replaced by 6.0001 using Python.

- [CS 61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a) - UC Berkeley. ([ Composing Programs](http://composingprograms.com/))

  This is UC Berkeley's introductory course on programming initially taught using Scheme but updated to use Python since 2011.
