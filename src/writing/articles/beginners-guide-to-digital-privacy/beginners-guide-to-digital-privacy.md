The following are basic instructions for beginners on maintaining privacy on the Internet. I use most of these services myself and highly recommend using these. Most of these are open-source projects. Please contribute to the maintainers via donations/code if you find them useful.

_\* Slightly advanced tips_

### Basics
- Understand why maintaining privacy is important. Start here:
  - [privacytools.io](https://privacytools.io/)
  - [r/privacy wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/wiki)
  - [Permanent Record- Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Record_(autobiography))

- Always look for well known open source alternatives to services that you use:
  - [AlternativeTo.net](https://alternativeto.net/)
  - [ethical.net](https://ethical.net/)
  - [Restore Privacy](https://restoreprivacy.com/)

- Start by using reliable open source web browsers:
  - [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
  - [Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium)
  - [Tor](https://torproject.org)

- Install privacy addons:
  - [Privacy Badger](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/)
  - [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/)
  - [Decentraleyes](https://decentraleyes.org/)
  - [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/)
  - [ClearURLs](https://gitlab.com/KevinRoebert/ClearUrls), etc.

- Use a search engine that doesn't log your search queries:
  - [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)
  - [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/)
  - [Searx](https://searx.me/)
  - [Qwant](https://qwant.com/)

- Disable Tracking, Fingerprinting, Cryptominers and Telemetry from browser preferences. Clear cookies frequently, disable location access to sites and cover your webcam unless necessary.

- Quit using Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook products for **personal/sensitive use cases**.
  
  These companies are great for security of your data, they hire top engineers from around the world but are worse for your privacy, esp. if they rely on advertisement for their revenue. If you have to use Google, go to your account settings and turn off all the [activity controls](https://myactivity.google.com/activitycontrols) and [ads personalization](https://adssettings.google.com/). Go through similar settings on your dashboard for other accounts- Apple, Microsoft, etc.

- **Always** choose "Sign up with Email" while signing up on websites.
  
  I cannot stress this enough. Please **do not** ever, unless mandatory, choose "Sign up with Google/Microsoft/Twitter/Facebook/Apple/Amazon, etc".
  
  If you are required to continue with social signup, take care of what scopes and information you are permitting the service to use. Platforms usually provide a way to manage this info from your account settings:
  - [Facebook Apps and Websites](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications)
  - [Apps with access to your Google account](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)

- Create separate email accounts/aliases for signups, newsletters, communication, banking, music, etc.

- Research beforehand if the service you're signing up for allows for an (easy) way to delete your account. You might regret later when you find out you can't delete your account. Some websites have tricky account deletion procedure:

  - Amazon, Adobe (require contacting support)
  - TED (no delete account option in account settings)
  - Shopify (you must have a premium subsciption to close your store/account even if wish to close your store after your trial is over)

- Make use of [Email Aliases](https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/addresses-and-aliases/) or Email forwarding services:
  - [AnonAddy](https://github.com/anonaddy/anonaddy)
  - [SimpleLogin](https://github.com/simple-login/app)

- Use disposable email addresses for temporary signups:
  - [Temp Mail](https://temp-mail.org/)
  - [10 Minute Mail](https://10minutemail.com/)
  
- Use alternative frontends for platforms like Twitter, YouTube and Instagram:
  - [Invidio.us](https://invidio.us/)
  - [Nitter.net](https://nitter.net/)
  - [Bibliogram](https://bibliogram.net/)

- Don't like/comment on anything on Facebook, YouTube and social platforms. Use E2E-encrypted bookmark service like [Firefox Sync](https://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/sync/).

  Platforms these days track everything from what your see, what you click on, share or comment on, and even how long you looked at a particular item on your feed. Reduce your digital footprint as much as you can. Export your personal data from Facebook, Google from your account settings and work on deleting all of it.
  - [Download your Facebook Information](https://facebook.com/dyi)
  - [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com)

- Use decentralized services if you need:
  - [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/)
  - [PixelFed](https://pixelfed.org/)
  - [Diaspora](https://diasporafoundation.org/)
  - [Fediverse](https://fediverse.party/)

- Use E2E-encrypted messaging applications for communication:
  - [Signal](https://signal.org/)
  - [Wire](https://wire.com)

- Use E2E-encrypted email services:
  - [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/)
  - [Protonmail](https://protonmail.com/)

- Use E2E-encrypted note-taking apps:
  - [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/)
  - [Joplin](https://joplin.org/)

- Use E2E-encrypted cloud storage solutions:
  - [Tresorit](https://tresorit.com/)
  - [pCloud Cypto](https://pcloud.com/)
  - [Sync.com](https://sync.com/)

- Encrypt your files before uploading them to Dropbox, Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive:
  - [VeraCrypt](https://veracrypt.fr/)
  - [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/)

- Use a reliable VPN:
  - [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/)
  - [Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net/)

- *Use a better DNS resolver:
  - [Cloudflare WARP](https://1.1.1.1/)

- *Use Linux/BSD. Any distro is fine:
  - Made for privacy: [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/), [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/), [Trisquel](https://trisquel.info/)...
  - Debian based: [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)...
  - Arch based: [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/), [ArcoLinux](https://arcolinux.info/), [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/),...
  - BSDs: [OpenBSD](https://github.com/openbsd/src), [NetBSD](https://www.netbsd.org/), [FreeBSD](https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/)...

- *Switch your OS on your smartphone:
  - [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/)
  - [Ubuntu Touch](https://ubuntu-touch.io/)
  - [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/)
  - [postmarketOS](https://postmarketos.org/)

- *Self-host software on your own server by renting a VPS.

### Bonus security tips:
- Use an open source password manager:
  - [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
  - [Keepass](https://keepass.info/)

- Enable [multi-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) on as many accounts as you can. Use an authenticator app like [FreeOTP](https://github.com/freeotp/) or [Authy](https://authy.com/) instead of giving out your phone number to services (**Don't forget to set necessary recovery options and backup 2FA recovery codes for important accounts!**).

- Monitor if youâ€™ve been part of an online data breach:
  - [Firefox Monitor](https://monitor.firefox.com/)
  - [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)
